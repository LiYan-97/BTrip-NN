# BTrip-NN
This study focuses on the task of individual trip chain prediction and proposes a neural network framework (BTrip-NN: Basic Trip Neural Network) that integrates multi-modal graph learning and dynamic utility mechanisms, built and validated based on a computational graph.
Considering the data privacy requirements, only a portion of anonymized and aggregated sample data is provided in the code.
